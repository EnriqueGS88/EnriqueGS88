## Hi! I'm Enrique 👋

I'm a Solution Manager that has picked up a passion for building blockchain apps.

## What I do 🎨

Currently I'm working on an NFT that changes together with the weather. 

## What I've done 👷‍♂️

Recently created an NFT that generates its image from a verifiable random number. Then stored this image forever on the Ethereum blockchain on the block [redacted] transaction [redacted].

The OpenSea collection is here: [redacted]

## What I want to do next 🚀

The intersection between NFTs and DeFi overly exciting for me. I want to experiment with insurance, options, rebasing tokens + an NFT on top of it.
I want to build something nice that leverages both practices.
