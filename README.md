## Hi! I'm Enrique 👋
---
I'm a Solution Manager that has picked up a passion for building blockchain apps.
<br />

## What I do 🎨

Currently I'm working on an NFT that changes together with the weather. 

## What I've done 👷‍♂️

Recently created an NFT that generates its image from a verifiable random number. Then stored this image forever on the Ethereum blockchain on the block ?_[redacted]_ transaction _[redacted]_.

The OpenSea collection is here: _[redacted]_

## What I want to do next 🚀

The intersection between NFTs and DeFi is quite exciting for me. I want to experiment with insurance, options, rebasing tokens + an NFT on top of it.
I want to build something nice that implements both practices.
